<p>Neptune: A Domain Specific Language for Deploying HPC  Software on Cloud
Platforms</p>

<p>Neptune provides programmers with a simple interface by which they can
deploy MPI, X10, MapReduce, UPC, and Erlang jobs to without needing to know
the particulars of the underlying cloud platform. You only need to give
Neptune your code, tell it how many machines to run on and where to put the
output: Neptune handles everything else. No more writing configuration
files, having to start up NFS on all your machines, yada yada yada. Neptune
works together with supported cloud platforms (currently AppScale is
recommended) and can deploy over anything AppScale can - Xen or KVM virtual
machines as well as Eucalyptus and Amazon EC2. There’s nothing
virtualization specific in there, so in theory any machine installed with
the AppScale software should work fine.</p>

<p>Although Neptune is designed to automate deploying HPC jobs, it also can be
used to deploy other types of software. For example, Neptune has support
for user-specified scaling of the underlying cloud platform: users can
write Neptune jobs that manually add load balancers, application servers,
or database servers to a running AppScale deployment. Additionally, as of
version 0.0.2, remote compiling can also be performed: just give Neptune
the path to the directory you want to compile and be sure to include a
Makefile in it! Neptune will run ‘make’ on it (you can specify which
target to make as well) and return to you a folder containing the standard
out and standard error of the make command.</p>

<p>By default, Neptune jobs store their outputs in the underlying database
that AppScale is running over. As of Neptune 0.0.5, job outputs can also be
stored in Amazon S3, Eucalyptus Walrus, and Google Storage.</p>

<p>Sample Neptune job scripts can be found in samples. Test cases can be found
in the test folder, with the standard naming convention</p>
<ul><li>
<p>ts_neptune is the test suite runner, with tc_* containing test</p>
</li></ul>

<p>cases for each type of job that Neptune offers. Before running ts_neptune,
you should export the environment variable APPSCALE_HEAD_NODE, which should
be set to the IP address of the AppScale machine that runs the Shadow
daemon (a.k.a. the Master AppController).</p>

<p>Developed by Chris Bunch as part of the AppScale project. See <a
href="LICENSE.html">LICENSE</a> for the specifics of the New BSD License by
which Neptune is released.</p>

<p>Contributors welcome! We would love to add support for other cloud
platforms and test out Neptune more on non-virtualized deployments, as well
as adding capabilities for other types of computation. We would also like
to refactor Neptune to use symbols instead of instance variables for
running jobs: this will likely appear in a future release as well.</p>

<p>An academic paper describing Neptune is in the works - check in for a link
to that as it becomes available.</p>

<p>Version History:</p>

<p>April 2, 2001 - 0.0.7 released, adding automatic test suite and many bug
fixes for all scenarios. rcov can also be used to generate test coverage
information: current coverage stats can be found in coverage directory.
mapreduce broken at the moment - will fix in next release</p>

<p>March 28, 2011 - 0.0.6 released, adding support for input jobs, so users
can place data in the datastore without having to run any computation</p>

<p>March 18, 2011 - 0.0.5 released, adding support for storage outside of
AppScale to be used. Tested and working with Amazon S3 and Google Storage</p>

<p>February 10, 2011 - 0.0.4 released, adding UPC and Erlang support, and
restructuring syntax to pass in hashes to method calls instead of passing
in blocks</p>

<p>February 4, 2011 - 0.0.3 released, allowing users to use Neptune properly
as a gem within Ruby code</p>

<p>February 4, 2011 - 0.0.2 released, adding support for remote compiling</p>

<p>January 27, 2011 - 0.0.1 released, with initial support for MPI, X10, and
MapReduce.</p>
